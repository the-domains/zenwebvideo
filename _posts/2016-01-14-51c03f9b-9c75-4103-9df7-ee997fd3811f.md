# Nuke 10 is coming soon

> Our software solutions are anything but ordinary. The workflows they create serve multiple industries and generally make doing creative things a walk in the park.

We know that tools in VFX are also relevant to designers and vice versa. It's that understanding that helps us to develop flexible, open products that solve problems.

The portfolio is as creative as it is technical, packed full of groundbreaking award-winning techy goodness that will have even the most demanding organization or one-man-show salivating.
